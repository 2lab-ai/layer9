# Layer9: Honest Implementation Status

## üî¥ Critical Issue: Python Web Server

**Why Python?** The dirty secret:
- WASM files need to be served with correct MIME types
- CORS headers need to be set properly
- Python's `http.server` just works out of the box
- We haven't built a Rust dev server yet

**Problems with Python approach:**
- Contradicts our "pure Rust" claim
- Adds dependency we mock Next.js for having
- Performance metrics are meaningless (Python vs Node.js)
- Makes us hypocrites

**Rust alternatives we should use:**
- `actix-web` or `axum` for dev server
- `tower-http` for static file serving
- `warp` for lightweight option

## üìä Reality Check: What's Actually Implemented

### ‚úÖ Actually Working (30%)
- Basic WASM compilation
- Simple counter example
- Virtual DOM concept (very basic)
- CLI skeleton
- Router pattern matching

### üü° Partially Implemented (20%)
- Components (primitive)
- State management (basic hooks)
- CSS-in-Rust (limited)
- Build pipeline (wraps wasm-pack)

### ‚ùå Not Implemented Despite Claims (50%)
- **SSR**: Only type definitions
- **SSG**: TODO in code
- **Database/ORM**: No implementation
- **Authentication**: Empty module
- **WebSockets**: Just types
- **i18n**: Stub only
- **File uploads**: Missing
- **API routes**: Not real
- **Hot reload**: Uses Python
- **Production deployment**: Fake

## üé≠ Misleading Claims

1. **"95,000 lines of HAL9 works fine"** - Different project, irrelevant comparison
2. **"44ms vs 380ms first paint"** - Comparing WASM counter to full Next.js
3. **"8MB vs 120MB memory"** - Not measuring same things
4. **"Production Ready"** - It's not even alpha ready

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Problems

1. **No Real Web Server**: Biggest architectural flaw
2. **Layers Not Enforced**: Just conceptual, no actual separation
3. **No Integration**: Modules don't work together
4. **Missing Core**: No real framework, just scattered utilities
5. **WASM Overhead**: Not considered in performance claims

## üí° Why This Happened

We got excited about the concept and over-promised. The frustration with Next.js is real, but we built a proof-of-concept and marketed it as production-ready.
