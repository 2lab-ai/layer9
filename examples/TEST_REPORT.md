# Layer9 Examples Test Report

## Test Summary

Date: June 12, 2025
Tested by: Automated Test Suite

## Examples Status

### 1. Counter Example ‚úÖ WORKING
- **Build Status**: Built successfully (pkg directory exists)
- **Features Tested**:
  - WASM loads correctly
  - Initial render displays counter at 0
  - Increment button works (+1)
  - Decrement button works (-1)  
  - Quick increment buttons work (+10)
  - State updates reflect correctly in UI
  - Status, distance from zero, and square calculations work
- **Issues**: 
  - Minor: "closure invoked recursively" warnings in console (non-blocking)
- **Screenshots**: Captured initial, incremented, and decremented states

### 2. Todo App Example ‚úÖ WORKING
- **Build Status**: Built successfully (pkg directory exists)
- **Features Tested**:
  - WASM loads correctly
  - Can add new todo items
  - Todo items display with timestamps
  - Can toggle todo completion status
  - Can delete todo items
  - Filter buttons (all/active/completed) render correctly
  - Counter shows correct active/completed counts
- **Issues**: None
- **Screenshots**: Captured empty state, with items, and final state

### 3. Async Counter Example ‚ùå BUILD FAILED
- **Build Status**: Failed to build
- **Issues**:
  - Syntax errors in view! macro - using JSX-like syntax not supported
  - Missing ErrorInfo import
  - Incorrect use_state destructuring pattern
  - inject_global_styles function signature mismatch
- **Recommendation**: Needs code refactoring to match current Layer9 API

### 4. GitHub Dashboard Example ‚ùå EXCLUDED FROM BUILD
- **Build Status**: Commented out in workspace Cargo.toml
- **Issues**:
  - Known view! macro syntax issues (as noted in Cargo.toml comment)
  - Not included in workspace members
- **Recommendation**: Requires significant refactoring before testing

### 5. Next.js Integration Example üìÑ DOCUMENTATION ONLY
- **Build Status**: N/A - Documentation only
- **Content**: Provides guidance on integrating Layer9 with Next.js projects
- **No executable code to test**

## Test Infrastructure

### Testing Tools Used
- Puppeteer for browser automation
- Python HTTP server for serving examples
- Screenshot capture for visual verification

### Test Coverage
- Page load and WASM initialization
- UI component rendering
- User interaction (clicks, input)
- State management
- Error handling

## Recommendations

1. **Priority Fixes**:
   - Fix async-counter syntax to match current Layer9 API
   - Update github-dashboard to use correct view! macro syntax
   
2. **Minor Improvements**:
   - Investigate and fix "closure invoked recursively" warnings in counter example
   - Add more comprehensive error handling in examples

3. **Testing Enhancements**:
   - Add automated CI/CD testing for all examples
   - Include performance benchmarks
   - Add accessibility testing

## Conclusion

2 out of 4 executable examples are fully functional (50% success rate). The working examples (counter and todo-app) demonstrate core Layer9 functionality including:
- Reactive state management
- Event handling
- Component rendering
- WASM integration

The framework shows promise but needs attention to maintain example code compatibility with API changes.
