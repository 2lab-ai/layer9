I need you to implement the following TODO from the Layer9 framework project: "CRITICAL: Make counter example use Layer9, not raw DOM"


The counter example currently uses raw DOM manipulation. You need to:
1. Read the current counter example at examples/counter/src/lib.rs
2. Understand the Layer9 component system by examining crates/core/src/component.rs and crates/core/src/state.rs
3. Rewrite the counter example to use Layer9 components, state hooks, and event handling
4. Ensure it still compiles to WASM and works correctly
5. The counter should increment/decrement when buttons are clicked
6. Use Layer9's html! macro and component system instead of raw DOM manipulation

Make sure to maintain the same functionality while demonstrating proper Layer9 framework usage.
