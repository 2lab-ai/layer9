I need you to implement the following TODO from the Layer9 framework project: "SSR: Server-side rendering not implemented yet"


Server-Side Rendering is currently not implemented. You need to:
1. Examine crates/core/src/ssr.rs and identify placeholder code
2. Implement actual HTML generation from components
3. Add hydration markers for client-side rehydration
4. Update crates/layer9-server/src/main.rs to use the SSR functionality
5. Ensure components can render to HTML strings on the server
6. Handle async data fetching during SSR

Focus on getting basic SSR working first, then optimize.
