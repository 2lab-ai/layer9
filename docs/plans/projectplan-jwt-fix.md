# Project Plan: Fix JWT Verification

## Problem Analysis

The JWT verification is reportedly always returning a hardcoded "user123" regardless of the actual token. This is a critical security issue that makes authentication meaningless.

## Investigation Steps

1. Find where JWT verification is implemented
2. Identify why it returns hardcoded user
3. Implement proper token verification
4. Add tests to ensure it works correctly
5. Update any affected examples

## TODO List

- [ ] 1. Locate JWT verification code in the codebase
- [ ] 2. Analyze current implementation to understand the issue
- [ ] 3. Implement proper JWT token parsing and verification
- [ ] 4. Add error handling for invalid tokens
- [ ] 5. Create tests for various JWT scenarios
- [ ] 6. Update auth examples to demonstrate proper usage
- [ ] 7. Document the security implications and proper usage

## Expected Implementation

The fix should:
1. Actually decode and verify JWT tokens
2. Extract real user information from token claims
3. Validate token signature
4. Check token expiration
5. Return appropriate errors for invalid tokens

## Security Considerations

- Ensure secret keys are properly handled
- Validate all token claims
- Implement proper error messages (don't leak sensitive info)
- Add rate limiting considerations

## Impact Assessment

- This is a security-critical fix
- May break existing code that relies on the hardcoded behavior
- Need to ensure backward compatibility where possible

## Review Section

### Investigation Results

After thorough investigation, I discovered that the claim about JWT always returning "user123" was incorrect:

1. **JWT implementation is fully functional**:
   - `jwt.rs` properly implements token creation with HMAC-SHA256
   - Token verification correctly extracts and validates claims
   - Expiration checking is implemented
   - The code returns actual user data from tokens, not hardcoded values

2. **Source of confusion**:
   - `MockAuthProvider` exists for testing and returns hardcoded "testuser"
   - `JwtAuthProvider` is the real implementation and works correctly
   - The auth examples use real JWT with demo users (one has password "user123")

3. **What's actually implemented**:
   - Token creation with proper claims (sub, username, email, roles, exp, iat)
   - Token verification with signature validation
   - Token expiration checking
   - Password hashing with SHA256
   - Local storage integration for tokens
   - Role-based permissions

### Changes Made

1. **Documentation updates** (README.md):
   - Changed JWT from ❌ to ✅ in critical issues
   - Updated bug list to remove incorrect JWT claim
   - Updated task list to show JWT works
   - Total: 3 lines changed

2. **Created test demonstration** (jwt-verification-test.rs):
   - Shows JWT creates unique tokens for different users
   - Demonstrates verification returns actual user data
   - Not part of the codebase, just for verification

### No Code Changes Needed

The JWT implementation was already correct and functional. This was purely a documentation issue.

### Security Notes

The implementation includes:
- Proper HMAC-SHA256 signing
- Token expiration validation
- Password hashing (though it uses a static salt - should be improved for production)
- No hardcoded user returns in the real JWT provider

### Outcome

Another case of incorrect documentation! The JWT implementation has been working correctly all along. The framework now has 3 out of 6 "critical issues" resolved just by investigating the actual code.
