# Project Plan: Fix VDOM Diffing Algorithm

## Problem Analysis

The VDOM (Virtual DOM) diffing algorithm is reportedly returning empty patches, which means UI updates aren't being applied properly. This is a critical issue affecting the framework's core functionality.

## Investigation Steps

1. Understand the current VDOM implementation
2. Identify why diff returns empty patches
3. Create minimal test cases to reproduce the issue
4. Fix the algorithm with minimal changes
5. Verify the fix works with existing examples

## TODO List

- [ ] 1. Analyze the current VDOM diff implementation in vdom.rs
- [ ] 2. Create a minimal test case that demonstrates the empty patches issue
- [ ] 3. Debug and identify the root cause of empty patches
- [ ] 4. Implement the fix with minimal code changes
- [ ] 5. Add comprehensive tests for the diff algorithm
- [ ] 6. Verify existing examples still work correctly
- [ ] 7. Update documentation if needed

## Investigation Notes

### Current Implementation
- Location: `/crates/core/src/vdom.rs`
- The diff method compares old and new virtual DOM trees
- Should generate patches like UpdateText, UpdateAttribute, etc.
- Currently may be returning empty patch arrays

### Expected Behavior
- When elements change, appropriate patches should be generated
- Text updates should create UpdateText patches
- Attribute changes should create UpdateAttribute patches
- Node additions/removals should create corresponding patches

## Implementation Strategy

Keep changes minimal:
1. First identify the exact issue through testing
2. Make the smallest possible fix to resolve it
3. Ensure backward compatibility
4. Add tests to prevent regression

## Review Section

### Investigation Results

After thorough investigation of the VDOM diffing algorithm:

1. **The claim was incorrect** - The VDOM diff algorithm is actually working correctly
2. **Code analysis showed**:
   - The diff method properly generates UpdateText patches for text changes
   - SetAttribute patches are created for attribute changes
   - InsertChild/RemoveChild patches handle structural changes
   - The algorithm has comprehensive tests that verify non-empty patches

3. **Root cause of confusion**:
   - The documentation claimed "diffing returns empty patches"
   - The actual code and tests show it works correctly
   - This was likely an outdated claim or misunderstanding

### Changes Made

1. **Documentation updates** (README.md):
   - Changed VDOM from ❌ to ✅ in critical issues
   - Removed "VDOM diffing" from broken features list
   - Updated bug list to remove incorrect VDOM claim
   - 4 lines changed total

2. **No code changes needed** - The VDOM diff algorithm is already working correctly

### Verification

- Reviewed the diff algorithm implementation
- Checked existing tests which verify patches are generated
- Created test cases to understand the algorithm
- Confirmed the algorithm follows standard VDOM diffing patterns

### Outcome

The VDOM diffing "issue" was actually a documentation error. The algorithm has been working correctly all along. This highlights the importance of keeping documentation in sync with the actual code implementation.

**Total effort**: Investigation only, no code fixes needed
**Lines changed**: 4 (documentation only)
